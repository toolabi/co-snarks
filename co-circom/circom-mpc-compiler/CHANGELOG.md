# Changelog

* The following workspace dependencies were updated
  * dependencies
    * circom-mpc-vm bumped from 0.4.1 to 0.4.2
  * dev-dependencies
    * co-groth16 bumped from 0.5.0 to 0.5.1

## [0.6.0](https://github.com/TaceoLabs/collaborative-circom/compare/circom-mpc-compiler-v0.5.0...circom-mpc-compiler-v0.6.0) (2024-08-21)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* we hardcoded bn128 as prime for the compiler. We now give either bn128 or bls12381 depending on curve. Introduces new trait bounds therefore breaking change
* Removed the builder step for the compiler as we now have a config anyways. Moved some stuff to the config

### Bug Fixes

* fixes prime for the mpc compiler ([5712184](https://github.com/TaceoLabs/collaborative-circom/commit/5712184748488b7bab735b456be25e9cbbdb5ff7))
